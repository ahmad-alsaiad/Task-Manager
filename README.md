# What is GTD
* Concept Created by David Allen 
* David Allen Explained how his concept works in his [Official-Website](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)
* GTD is a personal productivity methodology that redefines how you approach your life and work
# THE FUNDAMENTALS: Five clear steps that apply order to chaos
1. STEP 1) 
**CAPTURE**:
(*Collect what has your attention.*)
Write, record, or gather everything that has your attention into a **collection tool**.
2. STEP 2
**CLARIFY**:
(*Process what it means*)
Is it actionable? If so, decide the next action and project (if more than one action is required). If not, decide if it is disregardable, reference, or something to put on hold.
3. STEP 3
**ORGANIZE**:
(*Put it where it belongs*)
Mark reminders of your categorized content in appropriate places.
4. STEP 4
**REFLECT**:
(*Review frequently*)
Update and review all pertinent system contents to regain control and focus.
5. STEP 5
**ENGAGE**:
(*Simply do*)
Use your trusted system to make action decisions with confidence and clarity.

# The GTD Concept in the application
**Note:** the steps here are for using the app not the GTD system
# Step 1 
*  David Mentions that Step 1 is **CAPTURES**  
Here you can put everything that comes to your mind
# Step 2
* Step 2 is **Clarifying**
* If the task is actionable then it can be assigned to one of the following 5 categories:
    1) Do It Now
    2) Delegate 
    3) Calender
    4) Projects Incubator
    5) Some Day 
* When you finish doing your task then you should move it to the Archive category
* If the task is not actionable then you either should place it in the Reference category or just simply delete it if it is not important
# The Categories
1) **Captures:** Write what comes in your mind
2) **Do it now:** If the task takes a little bit of time 
3) **Delegate:** If you dont want to work on the task yourself then you can give it to somebody else
4) **Calender:** If the task has date and time
5) **Projects Incubator:** If the task is too long or if they are multiple tasks 
6) **Some Day:** If the task is a low priority task you can think about in the future 
7) **Reference:** If it is an information a website link etc... .
8) **Archive:** Access all finished tasks
